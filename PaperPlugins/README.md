# Paper Test Server Skeleton
This repo simply serves as a skeleton on the basics of a test server for [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)

You can fork this repo and use a modified version by setting PAPER_TEST_SKELETON environment variable, or by simply
resetting origin in your test server to your fork.

# Goal
The goal of this repository is to ensure a minimum test case for paper updates, so that we can be more comfortable that an update
to the server software does not cause breakage with other plugins, and to help identify when a breakage does occur so we
can work with plugin authors to come to a resolution.

This repo should not be used as a template to start your own server (there really is nothing special included in it!)

# Copyright
All plugins listed in this Repository are copyright their respective owners. Any plugin owner that wishes their plugin to not be
included, please open an Issue and we will remove it.

However, the intent of this repository is to ensure that your plugin continues to work and is not broken by Paper updates.
